## Key Takeaway

Social links provide valuable insights into project legitimacy and community health. Use them as part of your research process, but always verify information independently and never rely on social media presence alone for investment decisions.

**Remember**: A strong social media presence doesn't guarantee project success or safety. Always do comprehensive research! 🔍
