## 🛡️ Security Warnings

### **Scam Awareness**

- **Never share** private keys or seed phrases with anyone
- **Check multiple sources** before investing in any project

## 💰 Investment Guidelines

### **General Principles**

- **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
- **Diversify your investments** - don't put all money in one token
- **Start small** - learn with smaller amounts first
- **Have an exit strategy** - know when you'll take profits or cut losses
- **Stay informed** - keep up with project developments

### **Market Cap Focus**

- **Price is misleading** - a $0.01 token isn't necessarily "cheap"
- **Market cap shows true value** - total value of all tokens
- **Compare market caps** not prices when evaluating projects
- **Supply matters** - 1 billion tokens at $1 = $1B market cap

### **Red Flags to Avoid**

- **Unverified contracts** - no way to audit the code
- **Anonymous teams** - no accountability if things go wrong
- **Unrealistic promises** - "guaranteed" returns or "risk-free" investments
- **Pressure tactics** - "act now" or "limited time" offers
- **No real use case** - tokens without clear purpose or utility
